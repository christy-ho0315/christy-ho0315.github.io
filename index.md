### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3381162/assignments/34596717)

    Lab 4, part 1 was also one of my favorites because the calculations for date difference may be done with simple int types. Use of float or double is not even needed, which I thought was really impressive. Additionally, we started to learn how to format and lint check, which is driving us crazy.

* [Lab 8](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3381162/assignments/34650867)

    Lab 8, part 2 was also one of my choices because it introduced me how to name a variable, open a file, and initialize an open file. We apply the command-line option to write a message to a file.


* [Lab 12](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3381162/assignments/34727919)

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite of mine since I was always interested in the animation's technology. I was able to create the first animation with functions that I had written. I didn't think it would be easy, and I didn't think I could create an animation in my first year. I realized it wasn't that difficult because the GIF file format makes it simple to create an animation in the style of a flip book.
